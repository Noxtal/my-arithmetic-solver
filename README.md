A very basic Rust arithmetic solving approach for solving [Codewars' "Evaluate mathematical expression"](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52a78825cdfc2cfc87000005/rust) by [ankr](https://www.codewars.com/users/ankr). A really good way to get even more familiar with Rust, maybe this could evolve into it's own complete custom language. Who knows?
